      "description": "The Von Restorff effect, also known as the isolation effect, is a cognitive bias that predicts an item noticeably different from others will be more likely to be remembered. This concept hinges on the principle that unusual or distinctive features enhance memory recall within a list of otherwise homogenous items.",

      "description": "The Weber-Fechner law is a principle that attempts to explain the relationship between the physical magnitude of a stimulus and the perceived intensity of that stimulus, suggesting that the perceived change in a given stimulus is proportional to the initial intensity of that stimulus. It is named after Ernst Weber and Gustav Fechner, who pioneered early research in sensory perception.",

      "description": "The Well-traveled road effect is a cognitive bias that causes people to underestimate the time it takes to travel routes they are familiar with. This phenomenon suggests that people perceive regularly traveled paths as shorter than they objectively are, due to an increase in perceived efficiency and ease of navigation.",

This preference occurs even when the latter option is statistically safer or more advantageous. This bias reflects our affinity for certainty and the psychological comfort derived from completely eradicating a particular risk.",
